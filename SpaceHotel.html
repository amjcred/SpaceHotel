    <p>The Gateway Foundation has announced that it intends to open the first hotel in space, named Voyager Station, in 2027.
        Voyager Station will be built by construction company Orbital Assembly Corporation, which describes itself as "the world's first large scale space construction company".
        According to the organisation, construction of the 50,000-square-metre facility will start in 2026 with the first passengers visiting the hotel in 2027.
        When it opens, the rotating hotel will have rooms for up to 440 people. The rotating ring-shaped form will give the station gravity equivalent to one-sixth of the Earth's.</p>
    <p>According to the organisation, Voyager Station will be designed to have the "feel of a luxury hotel", with comfortable interiors that reject the sleek futurist look often depicted in films.
        "In the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick's Space Station 5 is a sterile, white, museum-like hotel," explained Alatorre in an interview with Dezeen.
        "While it made for a clearly futuristic feeling in the movie, in reality, it wasn't a very inviting space. As humans, we innately connect to natural materials and colours."</p>
